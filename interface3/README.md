# Interface3 - Raspberry Pi Pico W based 3270 Terminal Adapter

Interface3 is an alternative hardware solution to connect a 3270 coax
terminal to host systems through the oec terminal controller software
written by Andrew Kay.  It consists of a Raspberry Pi Pico-based
hardware interface and firmware that implements the coax protocol used
by 3270 terminals in CUT mode.

Two firmwares run on the interface:

- **C firmware** (`firmware/`): built with the Raspberry Pi Pico SDK
  for the Pico, Pico W, Pico 2 and Pico 2 W.  It drives all four coax
  ports over USB serial, captures coax traffic for Wireshark, and
  restarts into the USB bootloader for remote updates.
- **MicroPython firmware** (`src/`): runs on MicroPython 1.26.0 or
  later on a Pico W and supports both the serial and the WiFi
  connection mode.

## Overview

Interface3 enables communication with IBM 3270 terminals by:

1. **Hardware Interface**: A custom PCB with a Raspberry Pi Pico and
   up to four serial coax interfaces that implement the physical layer
   connection to 3270 terminals.
2. **Protocol Implementation**: The Manchester-encoded coax protocol
   is implemented using PIO blocks of the RP2040 microcontroller.
3. **Connection Modes**: Two connection modes are supported:
   - **Serial Mode**: Direct USB serial connection to a host running
     oec/pycoax, compatible with interface2.  Requires Andrew Kay's
     original [oec](https://github.com/lowobservable/oec).  Both
     firmwares support it.
   - **WiFi Mode**: TCP client that connects to an oec server over
     WiFi using a custom binary protocol.  Requires the modified
     [oec-tcp](https://github.com/hanshuebner/oec-tcp).  Supported by
     the MicroPython firmware.

## How It Works

### Hardware Layer
The interface uses a Raspberry Pi Pico with custom PCB that provides:
- Two Coax interfaces with proper signal conditioning
- Two additional serial interfaces with TTL levels on a pin header
- LED indicators to display the operating state of the interface
- Momentary button that resets the Raspberry Pi Pico
- USB B socket for power supply and serial connection

### Software Layer

Both firmwares implement the line level Manchester-encoded protocol
in a [PIO](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/what-is-pio/) block.  This
offloads the handling of the real-time protocol requirements from the
main ARM CPU.  Data between the CPU and the PIO blocks is exchanged
through DMA, so the firmware operates only on full frames.

The C firmware (`firmware/`) uses TinyUSB to present one USB serial
port per coax port plus a capture port, and speaks the interface2
SLIP protocol on each of them.  The MicroPython firmware (`src/`)
implements the rest of the interface in MicroPython, using its DMA
library to reach the PIO blocks.

## Installation

### C Firmware

#### Prerequisites

- The interface3 PCB with a Raspberry Pi Pico, Pico W, Pico 2 or
  Pico 2 W installed
- `cmake`, `ninja` and the `arm-none-eabi-gcc` toolchain
- The Pico SDK, vendored as a git submodule under `firmware/pico-sdk`:

  ```bash
  git submodule update --init --recursive firmware/pico-sdk
  ```

  Set `PICO_SDK_PATH` to use an SDK installed elsewhere.

#### Building

```bash
make            # all four boards
make pico2      # one board: pico, pico_w, pico2 or pico2_w
```

Each board is built in `firmware/build-<board>/`, and its image is
copied to `coax_interface-<board>.uf2` in this directory.

#### Flashing

Connect the Pico to your workstation using its USB port while holding
the small white "BOOTSEL" button, then copy the image for your board to
the USB drive that appears (`RPI-RP2` for a Pico, `RP2350` for a
Pico 2).  The interface restarts with the new firmware once the copy
is complete.

Later updates can be loaded without touching the board, see
[Updating the C Firmware](#updating-the-c-firmware).

### MicroPython Firmware

#### Prerequisites

1. **MicroPython with DMA Extensions**: You need a MicroPython release
   1.26.0 or later to get support for the DMA transfer library
   required by the firmware.

2. **Hardware**: The interface3 PCB with Raspberry Pi Pico installed

3. **Development Tools**:
   - `mpremote` for communicating with the Pico
   - `jq` for JSON processing (used by config-wifi.sh, WiFi mode only)

#### Common Installation Steps

1. **Flash MicroPython Firmware**:

   A prebuilt MicroPython image for the Raspberry Pi Pico W (RP2040
   version) can be downloaded from
   [my web site](https://vaxbusters.org/micropython-v1.26.0-rpi-pico-w.uf2).
   Connect the Raspberry Pi Pico W to your workstation using its Micro USB
   port while holding the small white "BOOTSEL" button, then copy the
   image to the USB drive that automatically appears (mounted as
   `/Volumes/RPI-RP2/` on Macs).

2. **Install mpremote**

   You can either install mpremote from your system's package repository
   or using pip.  When using pip, using a virtual environment is
   recommended:

   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   . .venv/bin/activate
   pip install mpremote
   ```

3. **Upload and install the firmware** using the install script:

   ```bash
   ./install.sh serial   # For serial mode
   ./install.sh wifi     # For WiFi mode
   ```

   The install script will upload all required files and configure
   the device for the selected mode.

### Updating the C Firmware

The C firmware restarts the Pico into its USB bootloader when any of its
serial ports is opened at 1200 baud, so a new image can be loaded from
the host it is attached to.  `tools/flash-interface <image.uf2>` does
this end to end: it triggers the restart, waits for the bootloader's
USB drive, copies the image onto it and waits for the interface to come
back.  A board whose firmware predates that hook is put into the
bootloader by hand once, by holding BOOTSEL while pressing reset; the
script waits for it.  The script uses `lsblk` and `udisksctl`, so it
runs on Linux hosts.

#### Serial Mode Setup (MicroPython)

After running `./install.sh serial`, the device is ready to use.
Connect to the interface using oec (see Usage section below).

#### WiFi Mode Setup (MicroPython)

After running `./install.sh wifi`, configure WiFi credentials:

```bash
./config-wifi.sh
```

This interactive script will:
- Prompt for WiFi network name and password
- Prompt for the hostname of the oec server
- Create a `config.json` file on the device
- Reset the device to apply the configuration

For testing, you can use my oec server running at netzhansa.com.
It is located in Germany, however, so the latency may be quite
high.  If you run oec on a port other than 3174, you can enter it
after the hostname, colon separated (host:port).

The device stores configuration in a `config.json` file:
```json
{
  "wifi": {
    "ssid": "your_network_name",
    "password": "your_network_password"
  },
  "connect_to": "your-oec-server.example.com"
}
```

## Usage

### Serial Mode

Serial mode requires Andrew Kay's original oec repository:
https://github.com/lowobservable/oec

Run oec with the serial port:

```bash
python -m oec /dev/tty.usbmodem* tn3270 your-host.example.com:23
```

Replace `/dev/tty.usbmodem*` with the actual device path (e.g.,
`/dev/tty.usbmodem1124101` on macOS, `/dev/ttyACM0` on Linux, or
`COM3` on Windows).

With the C firmware, the interface presents five serial ports: one
per coax port (`Coax Port 1` to `Coax Port 4`), followed by the
capture port.  Name the port you want explicitly rather than relying
on a glob.  On Linux, the names under `/dev/serial/by-id/` stay fixed
across reflashes; the [systemd units](./systemd/README.md) run one oec
session per coax port that way.

With the MicroPython firmware, the interface presents a single serial
port for its coax port.

#### Accessing the Python REPL (MicroPython)

During startup, the MicroPython firmware provides a 5-second window to access the
MicroPython REPL for debugging or configuration.  To access the REPL:

1. **Connect to the USB serial port** before or immediately after
   resetting the device.  Use a terminal program or mpremote:
   ```bash
   mpremote connect /dev/tty.usbmodem* repl
   ```

2. **Watch for the startup blink pattern** - the STS LED blinks slowly
   (250ms on, 250ms off) during this 5-second window.

3. **Press Ctrl-C** during this window to interrupt startup and enter
   the REPL.

**Important**: You must connect to the serial port *before* the
startup window expires.  Once the firmware enters protocol mode, the
serial port is used exclusively for SLIP-encoded communication and
keyboard interrupt is disabled.

### WiFi Mode

WiFi mode requires a modified version of oec that acts as a TCP server:
https://github.com/hanshuebner/oec-tcp

Start the oec-tcp server:

```bash
python -m oec --server :3174 tn3270 your-host.example.com:23
```

This starts oec listening on port 3174 for incoming connections from
interface3 devices.  When the interface connects to WiFi successfully,
it will automatically connect to the configured server.

See the [TCP Protocol documentation](./TCP_PROTOCOL.md) for details on
the network protocol.

### Capturing Coax Traffic

With the C firmware, the interface can record the coax traffic it exchanges with attached
terminals and hand it to Wireshark.  Capture happens in the firmware,
so both directions of every transaction are recorded as they appear on
the wire, with microsecond timestamps.

Records leave the device on a fifth USB serial port named `Coax
Capture`, which the four command ports are unaffected by.  Write a
capture file with:

```bash
tools/coax-capture --write coax.pcapng
```

To capture from the Wireshark GUI, install the capture plugin and the
dissector once:

```bash
tools/install-wireshark.sh
```

Idle polls are left out unless `--idle-polls` is given, since a
terminal is polled continuously.  See the [capture
documentation](./CAPTURE.md) for the record format, the filtering
options and the pcapng layout.

The interface can also record a link between some other controller and
a terminal, either sitting in the middle of it and forwarding between
two ports, or listening on one:

```bash
tools/coax-capture --forward 0,1 --write link.pcapng
tools/coax-capture --tap 0 --write tap.pcapng
```

See [Passive Capture](./PASSIVE-CAPTURE.md) for how to connect the
interface to a link and what to expect.  Forwarding needs a second coax
port that can transmit; boards built from the earlier layout need the
rework described in [PCB Rework](./PCB-REWORK.md).

## LED Indicators

The interface provides several LED indicators:
- **NET**: Network activity (WiFi mode only)
- **STS**: Status indicator
- **ERR**: Error indicator
- **TX1-4/RX1-4**: Individual channel transmit/receive indicators
- **PICO**: Raspberry Pi Pico onboard LED

### C Firmware LED Patterns

At power-up, the TX and RX LEDs light up in a sweep, followed by a
brief flash of ERR.

| LED | Pattern | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| STS | Blink (1s on, 1s off) | **Running** |
| TXn | Brief flash | **Transmit** - A frame was sent on port n |
| RXn | Off | **Port closed** - No host has the port's serial port open |
| RXn | Blink (1.9s on, 0.1s off) | **No terminal** - Port open, terminal not responding |
| RXn | Solid on | **Terminal connected** - Port open, terminal responding |

### MicroPython Serial Mode LED Patterns

| LED | Pattern | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| STS | Slow blink (250ms on/off) | **Startup window** - Press Ctrl-C to access REPL |
| STS | Fast blink (100ms on, 200ms off) | **Waiting for connection** - Ready for host to connect |
| STS | Once per second (100ms on, 900ms off) | **Connected** - Normal operation |
| ERR | Continuous fast blink (250ms on/off) | **Fatal error** - Unhandled exception occurred |

### MicroPython WiFi Mode LED Patterns

| LED | Pattern | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| NET | Fast blink (8Hz) | **Connecting to WiFi** - Attempting to join network |
| NET | Brief on, then off | **WiFi connected** - Successfully joined network |
| NET | On during activity | **Network activity** - Processing commands from server |
| STS | Solid on | **Connecting to server** - Attempting TCP connection |
| STS | Blink (1s on, 1s off) | **Reconnecting** - Connection lost, retrying |
| ERR | Solid on | **WiFi failed** - Could not connect to WiFi network |
| ERR | Solid on | **Coax timeout** - Terminal not responding (clears on success) |
